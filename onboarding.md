# Onboarding
This guide is designed to help with the onboarding process for the development team.

## Accounts
There are a few services we use to keep the Dev team working so please get accounts with the following:
1. [GitHub](https://github.com/): GitHub stores all of our code in the cloud as a remote git repository. Once you have a GitHub account please send your GitHub handle to [CJ-Wright](cjwright4242@gmail.com) so we can add you to the xpdAcq group.
1. [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/): ZenHub provides a bunch of agile development
1. [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/): We use Travis to check all of the builds of our code

## Development Workflow
